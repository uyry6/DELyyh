There are some minor typos corrected. Please read the latest version.

===================================

Updated 25 Aug 2018. 1200(TST)

I have fixed the problems you mentioned in the comments.
If I still miss something please tell me.

I kept some variables short(eg. s, t, ns, nt), because it's easy to know what it means.

I kept 9999999999 instead of using Maybe because I want to make every edge(even not exist) has there own weight.

Ignoring:
HLint Suggestion: Reduce duplication (6)
(Keeping them unchanged makes the examples clearer)

===================================

Mycode.lhs = my code

report.pdf = my report
